    <h1>Homemade Peanut Butter and Jelly</h1>

    <br>
    <p>When I was a boy my mother and I used to whip up this recipe on warm summer evenings, chilly winter days and even sometimes in the spring and fall too. Growing up in the fields of Illinois, you learn to enjoy the simple pleasures. To get satisfaction out of even the most basic of delicacies is a treat in and of itself, wouldn't you agree? Today (and any other day after you forget the recipe and come crawling back for more) I will teach you how to make the most mouth-watering sandwich mankind has come to know. The PB&J!</p>
    <h3>Mixings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Crunchy Peanut Butter (you can use creamy if preferred or if you have weak teeth)</li>
      <li>Grape Jelly is best, but whatever you have on hand should work</li>
      <li>Non Artisinal Bread</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Fixings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A Plate </li>
      <li>A Knife </li>
      <li>This recipe requries at least one hand, yours or otherwise</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Prep</h3>
    <p>First and foremost, there are <b>NO</b> strict measurements to this recipe, when I say slather, you go for the largest amount you're comfortable heaping onto the bread. I see people try to make this recipe into a health food, and if that is you, I'd recommend leaving this page right now. Start by getting two slices of your bread and placing at least one of the sliced sides on the plate per piece of bread. Now, did you remember your knife? That will be dipped into the jelly first, used in a scooping fasion and then slather that jelly onto one of the pieces of bread's sliced side that is still facing up. Going jelly first is <i>critical</i> in the success of the meal. I find one can still use the same knife to go for the peanut butter next because the jelly just slides off onto the bread, unlike the peanut butter which has a tendency to stick to the knife unless cleaned thoroughly. Now, a dollop of peanut butter will certainly do for your next slice, but trust me, you want at least two massive globs. The dispersion just works better, more substance more surface area coverage, you get the idea. Once you've layered both pieces with a satisfying amount of each ingredient, really take a moment to ask yourself if this is it. Is this the sandwich that will satisfy the carnal cravings of a person? Is it enough to satisfy <i>MY</i> cravings?? Probably. You may be asking, well what about the hands the recipe called for!? You've been using them the whole time, and I didn't have to even tell you! You're already cooking with the best of 'em and leaving behind the rest of 'em!</p>
