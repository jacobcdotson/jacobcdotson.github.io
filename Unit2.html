      <h3>Top Reasons To Get A Cat According to Psychologists</h3>
          <ol type=a>
            <li>Well-being- According to one Australian study, cat owners do have better psychological health than people without pets. On questionnaires, they claim to feel more happy, more confident, and less nervous, and to sleep, focus, and face problems in their lives better.</li>
            <li>Stress- It has been proven time and time again that having a pet in general can be linked to decreases in stressors present in an individual. Researchers at the University of Zurich have done empirical studies and ound that cat owners are generally less stressed before and after a stressful activity</li>
            <li>Interpersonal Relationships- “Pets appear to act as ‘social catalysts,’ inducing social contact between people,” write U.K. researcher Ferran Marsa-Sambola and his colleagues. “A pet can be accepting, openly affectionate, consistent, loyal, and honest, characteristics that can fulfill a person’s basic need to feel a sense of self-worth and loved.”</li>
          </ol>
